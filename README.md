# DeCOVID-CXR-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Detection-of-COVID-19-Infection-using-Chest-X-Rays

Language: Python <br>
IDE: Google Colab Notebook <br>
Library: Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch <br>

• Implemented a framework that was capable to do classification task on COVID-19 infection by using the Chest X-Rays images. <br>
• Integrated the deep learning model with clustering technique and image pre-processing technique. <br>
• Visualized the weights of features utilized by the models to verify the accuracy of the attention. <br>
